## Introduction 🚀

This project aims to predict flight delays using machine learning. Flight delays are a common concern for both travelers and airlines. By predicting these delays, airlines can better manage their schedules, and passengers can make informed decisions.

In this README, we will provide a comprehensive guide to understand, replicate, and contribute to this project.

## Project Overview 📈

Our project consists of several components:

### Data Collection 📦
We use historical flight data, specifically the "DelayedFlights" dataset, which contains a wealth of information about flights in the United States.

### Data Preprocessing 🧹
Raw data needs to be cleaned, and features should be transformed into a format suitable for machine learning. We also handle missing data and encode categorical variables.

### Model Building and Evaluation 🧪
We experiment with different machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest Classifier, xgboost, Support Vector Regressor and evaluate their performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The best-performing model will be deployed in the application.

### Deployment 🚀
We create a user-friendly web application using Streamlit. Users can input flight details, and the model predicts the expected delay. This application helps passengers make informed choices.

## Requirements 📋

Before starting, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Joblib, Streamlit
- The "DelayedFlights" dataset, available [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses]

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-delay-prediction.git
    cd flight-delay-prediction
    ```

2. Install the necessary Python packages.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Data Preprocessing 🧹

In the data preprocessing step, we clean and transform the dataset for use in machine learning. We also perform feature scaling and one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

To replicate this step, refer to the `data_preprocessing.py` script.

```bash
python data_preprocessing.py
```

## Model Building and Evaluation 🧪
We experiment with different machine learning models and evaluate their performance using metrics. The best model is then deployed.

To replicate this step, refer to the model_evaluation.py script.

```bash
python model_evaluation.py
```

## Using the App 📱
The heart of our project is the Streamlit web application. It provides an interface for users to input flight details and get predictions.

To install Streamlit application, execute the following:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

To run the application, execute the following:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Visit http://localhost:8501 in your web browser to use the app.
